    <h3>Description:</h3>
        
        <p>Whenever you make these cookies for someone, be sure to bring along several copies of the recipe! You will be asked for it, I promise!</p>
        <p>NOTE: I make icing with confectioners' sugar and milk. I make it fairly thin, as I 'paint' the icing on the cookies with a pastry brush.</p>
        <p>Thin enough to spread easily but not so thin that it just makes your cookies wet and runs off.</p>
